# Just Task Runner

Treat a justfile as a thin interface over project commands. Preserve existing recipe names and conventions.

Inspect recipe bodies and dependencies before execution. Add only requested recipes, preview changed paths
with `just --dry-run`, parse the resolved file with `just --dump`, and execute safe representative recipes.

Report the Just version, checks performed, and any execution path that remained untested.
