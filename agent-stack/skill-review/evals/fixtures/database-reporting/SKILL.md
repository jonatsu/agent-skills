# Database Reporting

Produce an accurate Markdown report from a local SQLite database.

Inspect the schema before writing a query. Parameterize user-supplied values, run the narrowest query that
answers the request, and preserve column names and units in the result.

Format the returned rows as a Markdown table. State the query, database path, row count, and any filters so
the reader can reproduce the report. Compare reported values with the query output before delivery.
